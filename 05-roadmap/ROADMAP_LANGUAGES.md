# ROADMAP: Languages to Know  

For Python Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, Machine Learning, and more.

These languages and formats appear throughout data analytics from early scripts to advanced machine learning and data products. Check the boxes as you add skills. 

---

## Documentation & Communication

- [ ] **Markdown** – Format notes, README files, and Jupyter content
- [ ] **reStructuredText** – Used in Sphinx and documentation tools (optional)
- [ ] **LaTeX** – ("la-TECH") Used in academic writing

---

## Programming & Scripting

- [ ] **Python** – Main language for data analytics, ML, BI, and automation
- [ ] **Excel (Formulas + Functions)** – Ubiquitous tool for tabular analysis, logic, and data prep. Often the first language used by analysts; includes formulas, pivot tables, and functions.
- [ ] **PowerShell** – Powerful cross-platform scripting tool for automation
- [ ] **Bash / Shell** – Command-line scripting for Linux/macOS/WSL workflows
- [ ] **R** – Widely used in statistics and data visualization (optional)

---

## Query & Data Definition

- [ ] **SQL** – Essential for querying, joining, and aggregating data in relational databases
- [ ] **DuckDB SQL** – SQL syntax for modern in-process analytics engines
- [ ] **NoSQL / MongoDB Query Language** – Used in document databases (for comparison)
- [ ] **Graph Query Languages (Cypher / GQL)** – Query network/graph data in tools like Neo4j or TigerGraph

---

## Data Formats & Configuration

- [ ] **CSV / TSV** – Common text-based data formats for tabular data
- [ ] **JSON** – Lightweight data format used in APIs, configs, and logs
- [ ] **YAML** – Readable format for configuration (e.g., workflows, Docker, CI/CD)
- [ ] **Parquet** – Columnar format for big data (used in Spark, DuckDB, etc.)
- [ ] **Pickle (.pkl)** – Python-specific binary format for saving/loading objects (use with caution; not human-readable or cross-language)

---

## Web, Text, and App Interfaces

- [ ] **HTML** – Structure for web content and dashboard layouts
- [ ] **CSS** – Styling for web content (limited use in dashboards or visual apps)
- [ ] **JavaScript** – Interactive behavior in web dashboards or NLP front ends (optional)

---

## Machine Learning & AI

- [ ] **Python with scikit-learn syntax** – For ML models, pipelines, and preprocessing
- [ ] **TensorFlow / PyTorch code syntax** – Deep learning frameworks
- [ ] **ONNX / SavedModel formats** – Model export formats for sharing ML models

---

## Streaming & Web Mining

- [ ] **Kafka message formats (JSON, Avro)** – For real-time data pipelines
- [ ] **Scrapy / BeautifulSoup syntax** – Python-based tools for web scraping
- [ ] **Regex** – Used across NLP, web scraping, and data cleaning


## BI & Automation Expression Languages

- [ ] **VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)** – Macro language for automating tasks in Excel and other Office tools  
  _Useful for building custom functions, automating reports, and interacting with Excel objects._

- [ ] **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Power BI’s formula language for dynamic measures and filters  
  _Essential for calculating KPIs, filtering visuals, and building responsive dashboards._

- [ ] **Power Query M** – Functional language used in Power BI and Excel's Power Query  
  _Used to clean, shape, and transform data visually or with custom expressions._
