## Windows Users
For Windows machines with OneDrive enabled, the Documents folder is not ideal for our GitHub projects due to OneDrive's automatic syncing. 
It slows things down when working with Python projects which can be very large (they use a lot of free code). 
We back them up ourselves using GitHub. 
We recommend creating a dedicated folder outside of OneDrive's sync scope, for example, a folder named Repos (short for repositories) in the root of your C: drive (i.e. C:\Repos, directions below).

### Windows Task 1. Create `C:\Repos` Directory

1. Open File Explorer.
2. Navigate to C:\.
3. Create a new folder named Repos.

Important

- Capitalize the "R" in Repos as programming is case-sensitive. Spelling and capitalization matter a great deal in programming. 
- Verify the new folder is directly in your C:\ (C:\Repos), not inside another folder like Documents or Desktop.
- Optional: Ensure the new directory is NOT being backed up by OneDrive or other sync services. Check OneDrive settings.

## Mac/Linux Users
We recommend keeping your GitHub projects organized and outside any cloud-sync directories like iCloud's Desktop or Documents. 
This ensures smoother performance, especially when working with Python projects, and avoids syncing unnecessary transient files.
We recommend creating a dedicated folder that is not synced, for example, a folder named Repos (short for repositories) in your Home folder (i.e. ~/Repos, directions below).

### Mac/Linux Task 1. Create `~/Repos` Directory

1. Click the Finder icon in your Dock to open a new Finder window.
2. Access Your Home Directory: In the Finder menu bar at the top of your screen, click Go, then select Home. Alternatively, press Command + Shift + H to open your Home folder.
3. Right-click (or Control-click) in the Home folder and select New Folder. Name the folder Repos.

Important

- Capitalize the "R" in Repos as programming is case-sensitive. Spelling and capitalization matter a great deal in programming. 
- Verify the new folder is located directly in your Home folder (~/Repos), not inside another folder like Documents or Desktop.
- Optional: Ensure this folder is NOT being backed up by iCloud if you have iCloud syncing enabled for your Desktop or Documents. To check: Go to System Settings > Apple ID > iCloud > iCloud Drive > Options and ensure "Desktop & Documents Folders" is unchecked.
