## Steps for Machine Setup

1. Enable file extensions and view hidden files and folders for your operating system:  
   - [01-view-hidden-files-and-extensions.md](01-view-hidden-files-and-extensions.md)

2. **Optional**: Install (or Verify) a Package Manager based on your operating system. Experienced users may choose to use a package manager. For most beginners, we recommend using the direct installers provided in Step 3. If you want to try these, choose 1:
   - [Linux: 02a-linux-install-apt.md](02a-linux-install-apt.md)  
   - [Mac:   02b-mac-install-brew.md](02b-mac-install-brew.md)  
   - [Windows: 02c-windows-install-winget.md](02c-windows-install-winget.md)

3. Install Python, Git, and Visual Studio (VS) Code based on your operating system. Choose 1:  
   - [Linux: 03a-linux-install-python-git-vscode.md](03a-linux-install-python-git-vscode.md)  
   - [Mac: 03b-mac-install-python-git-vscode.md](03b-mac-install-python-git-vscode.md)  
   - [Windows: 03c-windows-install-python-git-vscode.md](03c-windows-install-python-git-vscode.md)

4. Configure Git with user.name and user.email:  
   - [04-configure-git.md](04-configure-git.md)

5. Install common VS Code extensions:  
   - [05-install-vscode-extensions.md](05-install-vscode-extensions.md)

6. Create a dedicated folder to hold your GitHub projects:  
   - [06-create-projects-folder.md](06-create-projects-folder.md)

7. Create a GitHub Account:
   - [07-create-github-account.md](07-create-github-account.md)

8. Open VS Code in the `Repos` folder and use the integrated terminal to verify setup:
   - [08-open-vscode-in-folder.md](08-open-vscode-in-folder.md)
