This page provides instructions to install or verify **Python**, **Git**, and **Visual Studio Code** on a Windows machine using **official installers**.  
These tools are essential for professional data analytics.

## 1. Use Official Installers (Recommended for Most Users)

Download and Install Each Tool:

- **Python**: <https://www.python.org/> YOU MUST check **‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù** during installation. If you forget, rerun installation with the box checked.
- **Git**: <https://git-scm.com/>
- **VS Code** (Visual Studio Code): <https://code.visualstudio.com/>

Important: Remember to check the box to add Python to your path during installation.

## 2. Restart Computer After Installation

Restart your computer after installation (optional but recommended).

## 3. Verify

After restarting, open a new PowerShell terminal and run the following commands to verify. 

```powershell
py --version
pip --version
git --version
code --version
```

IMPORTANT: Each command should return a version number.
If any fail, revisit the installers and try again. 

## OPTIONAL/ADVANCED: Required Only If Using Advanced Tools like Apache Kafka or Apache Spark

This section is **required** only if you're using advanced tools like **Apache Kafka** or **Apache Spark**, which may not run reliably on base Windows.  
For these tools, use **WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) with **Ubuntu**.

You only need to do this setup once. After that, you‚Äôll use WSL2 for all Kafka/Spark projects.

### Advanced Step 1. Enable WSL2 and Install Ubuntu Operating System

In an **elevated PowerShell** terminal (right-click / Run as Administrator), run:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

Restart your machine if prompted.

### Advanced Step 2. Launch Ubuntu

After reboot, open **Ubuntu** from the Start Menu.

The first time you launch it:

- It will complete installation.
- You'll be asked to create a **username** and **password**.
- This is separate from your Windows account.
- **IMPORTANT: Remember your username and password**.  You can always recreate your WSL, but it helps to be able to return to your WSL installation after some time has passed. 


### Advanced Step 3. Update Ubuntu

Run the following commands inside your Ubuntu terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Advanced Step 4. Install Python 3.11 and pip

Ubuntu often comes with Python preinstalled, but we‚Äôll install the correct version:

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-distutils python3-pip
```

Verify installation:

```bash
python3.11 --version
pip3 --version
```

### Advanced Step 5. Install Git in WSL

```bash
sudo apt install -y git
git --version
```

### Advanced Step 6. Open VS Code from WSL

Install the **WSL Extension** for VS Code (if prompted, accept).

From the Ubuntu terminal, type:

```bash
code .
```

This opens VS Code inside WSL. You can now install any needed Python extensions **inside WSL** when prompted.

### Celebrate: Your Advanced WSL2 Setup is Complete!

You now have:

- A full Linux environment (Ubuntu) inside Windows.
- Python 3.11, pip, and git installed.
- VS Code integrated and running from WSL (or Windows - it's truly cross platform).

**Use WSL2 for all Kafka/Spark projects.**  
You can still use normal Windows for basic Python work.
Just remember to move to WSL2 when needed, e.g. for all projects using advanced tools like Apache Kafka or Apache Spark.
