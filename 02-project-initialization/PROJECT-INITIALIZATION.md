# Part 2: Project Initialization

This section provides step-by-step instructions to initialize a new Python project. 
These tasks include starting a project from scratch or using an existing template, setting up the project files, and creating a project virtual environment for development.

**IMPORTANT**: Complete all of Part 1 first:
1. [Set up the Machine](../01-machine-setup/MACHINE-SETUP.md)

## Steps for Project Initialization

1. EITHER Copy an Existing Project OR Create a New One From Scratch. Choose 1:
   - [01a-copy-existing-repo-in-github.md](01a-copy-existing-repo-in-github.md)  
   - [01b-create-repo-in-github.md](01b-create-repo-in-github.md)

2. ALWAYS Use Git to clone the new repository to your local machine:  
   - [02-clone-repo-to-local.md](02-clone-repo-to-local.md)

3. *IF starting from scratch only*: Add files such as `.gitignore` and `requirements.txt`:  
   - [03-add-gitignore-and-requirements.md](03-add-gitignore-and-requirements.md)

4. *IF starting from scratch only*: Use Git to add, commit, and push your new files to GitHub:  
   - [04-git-add-commit-push.md](04-git-add-commit-push.md)

5. ALWAYS Create a Local Python Virtual Environment for your project:  
   - [05-create-virtual-environment.md](05-create-virtual-environment.md)

## Important

- Initialize your project correctly to avoid issues later.
- Follow the steps carefully and in order.
- For projects that use templates or examples, review the project first and understand the starting structure.

## Pronounce Key Files and Folders Correctly

- When you see `.gitignore`, say "Dot Git Ignore" file.
- When you see `README.md`, say "READ ME Dot MD" file.
- When you see `requirements.txt`, say "Requirements Dot TXT" file.
- When you see `.venv`, say "Dot V E N V" folder.

NOTE: The auto-generated audio guide gets these correct some of the time, but not all. 
For best results, view the written guide and commands while listening.
